Reviewer #4: 
1. There are some layout problems in this paper. For example, the format of section title and text is same in Abstract, and the table title of Table 4 is under the table.

2.      Some descriptions are redundant in this paper. For example, Introduction should be segmented for clarity.

3.      This paper lacks of visualization results in experimental results.
4.      And there is also lacking of comparison experiments with CNN-based methods to prove the effectiveness of the proposed tool.

5.      For the references, please add more references published in recent years
